# ‚öïÔ∏èüí¨ ReDSM5: A Reddit Dataset for DSM-5 Depression Detection

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Looking for a quick preview?**  
> A fully paraphrased, anonymized sample with 25 entries is [publicly available on the Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/irlab-udc/redsm5-sample) ‚Äî no user agreement required!

## üö¶ Access Conditions

This dataset is gated. To obtain access, please complete the access request form at [ReDSM5 Agreement Form](https://www.irlab.org/ReDSM5_agreement.odt) and submit it via email to [eliseo.bao@udc.es](mailto:eliseo.bao@udc.es). Your request will be reviewed and you‚Äôll receive approval or further instructions by email.

## üìù Dataset Summary

**ReDSM5** is a corpus of 1,484 Reddit posts, each *sentence-level annotated* for presence or absence of the nine DSM-5 major depressive episode symptoms (or `SPECIAL_CASE` for expert discrimination cases), along with a clinical rationale from a licensed psychologist.

A **public paraphrased sample** is available for inspection and prototyping at [irlab-udc/redsm5-sample](https://huggingface.co/datasets/irlab-udc/redsm5-sample).  
This sample includes 25 entries, has been completely paraphrased to protect anonymity, and can be accessed without any agreement.

Unlike other datasets, **every annotation** includes:
- **`sentence_text`**: The relevant sentence from a Reddit post.
- **`DSM5_symptom`**: One of:
  - `DEPRESSED_MOOD`
  - `ANHEDONIA`
  - `APPETITE_CHANGE`
  - `SLEEP_ISSUES`
  - `PSYCHOMOTOR`
  - `FATIGUE`
  - `WORTHLESSNESS`
  - `COGNITIVE_ISSUES`
  - `SUICIDAL_THOUGHTS`
  - `SPECIAL_CASE` (for non-DSM-5 clinical/positive discriminations)
- **`status`**:  
  - `1` = relevant evidence for the symptom  
  - `0` = explicit negative (clinician-annotated absence of symptom)
- **`explanation`**: Short clinical rationale.
- **`post_id`, `sentence_id`**: For reference and grouping.

There is also a **full post file** with the original post text.

### üìÅ Files

- `redsm5_posts.csv`  
  - Columns: `post_id`, `text` (cleaned full post)
- `redsm5_annotations.csv`  
  - Columns: `post_id`, `sentence_id`, `sentence_text`, `DSM5_symptom`, `status`, `explanation`

## üí° Notes
- Each row in `redsm5_annotations_long.csv` is a unique `(post, sentence, symptom)` expert-annotated evidence.
- For multi-label tasks, group by `post_id`.
- For post-level text, use `redsm5_full_posts.csv`.
